# Advanced Audio Engine Architecture
## Evolutionary Leap in Audio Processing

### Reflection on Recent Implementations

Our recent RT-safety improvements (pre-allocated buffers, lock-free designs) laid crucial groundwork. However, they were reactive solutions to known problems. The next evolution requires **predictive, adaptive, and intelligent** systems that anticipate and prevent issues before they occur.

### Core Philosophical Shift

**From Static to Dynamic**: Traditional audio engines use fixed parameters. Our evolved system adapts in real-time.

**From Reactive to Predictive**: Instead of handling problems after detection, we predict and prevent them.

**From Isolated to Holistic**: Each component informs and enhances others through feedback loops.

## Advanced Architecture Components

### 1. Psychoacoustic Processing Layer

**Purpose**: Process audio based on human perception, not just raw signal data.

**Key Innovations**:
- **Bark Scale Analysis**: 24 critical bands matching human hearing
- **Loudness Modeling**: ITU-R BS.1387 (PEAQ) implementation
- **Masking Exploitation**: Reduce imperceptible information
- **Equal-Loudness Compensation**: ISO 226 contour application

**Intellectual Foundation**: Based on Zwicker's loudness model and Moore's research on auditory perception.

```python
# Example: Perceptual loudness computation
loudness_sones = psychoacoustic.compute_loudness(audio)
masked_audio = psychoacoustic.apply_masking(audio, masker)
```

### 2. Adaptive Signal Processing Chain

**Purpose**: Self-optimizing DSP that learns from signal characteristics.

**Key Innovations**:
- **Real-time Feature Extraction**: 
  - Spectral centroid (brightness)
  - Zero-crossing rate (harmonicity)
  - Onset detection (temporal events)
  - Crest factor (dynamics)

- **Parameter Adaptation**:
  - Auto-adjusting gain based on RMS history
  - Dynamic noise gate threshold
  - Adaptive compression ratios

**Mathematical Foundation**: 
- Spectral flux for onset detection: `F(n) = Σ max(0, |X(k,n)| - |X(k,n-1)|)`
- Adaptive threshold: `T(n+1) = αT(n) + (1-α)F(n)`

### 3. Intelligent Auto-Mixing System

**Purpose**: Autonomous mixing decisions using ML-inspired algorithms.

**Key Innovations**:
- **Correlation Matrix Learning**: Track inter-channel relationships
- **Priority Scoring**: Weight channels by importance metrics
- **Frequency Masking**: Prevent spectral collisions
- **Gradient Descent Optimization**: Converge to optimal mix

**Algorithm**:
```
1. Compute correlation matrix C between channels
2. Calculate priority scores P based on signal features
3. Optimize weights W using: W(t+1) = W(t) - η∇L(W)
4. Apply frequency-domain masking to reduce overlap
5. Mix with optimized weights
```

### 4. Scene Detection & Classification

**Purpose**: Context-aware processing based on audio content type.

**Scene Types**:
- **Speech**: Single-channel, low dynamics, specific ZCR range
- **Music**: Multi-channel, high onset density, rich harmonics
- **Ambient**: Low dynamics, minimal onsets, distributed spectrum
- **Mixed**: Combination characteristics

**Classification Features**:
- Channel activity patterns
- Spectral brightness distribution
- Onset density
- Dynamic range indicators
- Zero-crossing statistics

### 5. Predictive Resource Management

**Purpose**: Anticipate resource needs using statistical modeling.

**Key Capabilities**:
- **Processing Time Prediction**: 95th percentile modeling
- **Buffer Size Optimization**: Dynamic adjustment based on latency targets
- **Resource Allocation**: Preemptive scaling

**Statistical Model**:
```python
buffer_size = ceil(target_latency / percentile_95(processing_times)) * safety_factor
```

### 6. Advanced Telemetry System

**Purpose**: Comprehensive health monitoring and optimization feedback.

**Metrics Tracked**:
- **Quality**: THD, SNR, channel correlation
- **Performance**: XRUN events, processing times
- **Spectral**: Peak tracking, frequency masking efficiency
- **System**: CPU/memory usage, health score

**Health Score Algorithm**:
```
score = 100
score -= xrun_penalty(recent_xruns)
score -= thd_penalty(avg_thd)
score -= snr_penalty(avg_snr)
```

## Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Enhancement
```python
# In audio_engine.py __init__
if config.get('enable_advanced_features', False):
    from app.engine.advanced_audio import integrate_advanced_features
    integrate_advanced_features(self)
```

### Phase 2: Processing Pipeline
```python
def _process_advanced(self, frames):
    # Existing RT-safe processing
    buffers = self._get_input_buffers(frames)
    
    if self.advanced_processing_enabled:
        # Analyze all channels
        stats = [self.adaptive.analyze_signal(buf, i) 
                for i, buf in enumerate(buffers)]
        
        # Detect scene
        scene = self.scene_detector.update(stats)
        
        # Apply adaptive processing
        processed = [self.adaptive.process(buf, i) 
                    for i, buf in enumerate(buffers)]
        
        # Intelligent mixing
        if scene == 'music':
            mixed = self.mixer.mix(processed, stats)
        else:
            mixed = self._simple_mix(processed)
        
        # Update telemetry
        self.telemetry.update(stats)
    else:
        mixed = self._simple_mix(buffers)
    
    return mixed
```

### Phase 3: Feedback Loops

```python
class FeedbackController:
    """Orchestrates inter-component feedback."""
    
    def update(self):
        # Telemetry informs buffer management
        health = self.telemetry.get_health_score()
        if health < 70:
            self.buffer_manager.increase_safety_factor()
        
        # Scene informs mixing strategy
        if self.scene_detector.current_scene == 'speech':
            self.mixer.set_strategy('dialogue_enhancement')
        
        # Psychoacoustic informs adaptive processing
        loudness = self.psychoacoustic.compute_loudness()
        self.adaptive.set_target_loudness(loudness)
```

## Performance Optimizations

### SIMD Vectorization
```python
# Use NumPy's SIMD-optimized operations
spectrum = np.fft.rfft(audio)  # Internally uses FFTW with SIMD
correlation = np.dot(signal1, signal2)  # BLAS-accelerated
```

### Cache-Friendly Access Patterns
```python
# Process channels in blocks for better cache locality
BLOCK_SIZE = 64
for block_start in range(0, frames, BLOCK_SIZE):
    block_end = min(block_start + BLOCK_SIZE, frames)
    process_block(audio[block_start:block_end])
```

### Lock-Free Data Structures
```python
# Use atomic operations for stats updates
import multiprocessing
stats_array = multiprocessing.Array('d', self.channels * 5)  # Shared memory
```
